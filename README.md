# mutationSet.py
my name is Daniel Tomiwa.
I am a beginner learning python by using hackerrank.com python coding.

So this was a task given at hackerrank to  find the sum of the set after it has gone through some process of set making
It changes whatever values put it the Set by updating them with each set operation.
I hope you guys use it for something
